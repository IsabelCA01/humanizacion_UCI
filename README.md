Proyecto de grado 2 - humanizaci√≥n UCI

Created by **Isabel Castrillon Acosta**, June 2023 - November 2024

The objective is to create two web pages, one for the administrative staff and the other for the family/friends of the patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the CES clinic, in Medellin, Colombia. 

The administrative page will be used to update the status of patients, and send updates to family members. While the other one will allow the companions to see the information of their loved ones constantly updated. 

With this project we propose to support the humanization of the intensive care unit, and reduce noise pollution and congestion of telephone lines.
